# IndiCultre

> IndiCultre is a metaverse platform where users can explore and interact with different virtual museums. It enables users to bid and collect various authentic historic artifacts as NFTs through blockchain technology.


## Inspiration

> Our team was inspired by the growing interest in the metaverse and the potential it holds for various industries, including gaming, entertainment, and e-commerce. We wanted to create a platform that could allow users to create and explore their own unique virtual worlds. With that in mind, we also wanted to associate NFTs with real world heritage and culture, and hence we developed IndiCultre.
